Addressing Misleading Claims,"*The Tesla Team, January 9, 2024",Reuters published an article that leads with a wildly misleading headline and is riddled with incomplete and demonstrably incorrect information. This latest piece vaguely and nonsensically suggests there are thousands upon thousands of disgruntled Tesla customers. It’s nonsensical because it’s nonfactual—the reality is Tesla’s customer retention is among the best and highest in the industry.

The DFEH’s Misguided Lawsuit,"The Tesla Team, February 9, 2022","The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) intends to file a lawsuit against Tesla alleging systematic racial discrimination and harassment. This follows a three-year investigation during which the DFEH—whose mission is supposedly to protect workers—has never once raised any concern about current workplace practices at Tesla. Rather, the lawsuit appears focused on alleged misconduct by production associates at the Fremont factory that took place between 2015 and 2019."

We look forward to sharing further progress in future reports as we continue to innovate and enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion practices."
Health and Safety at Tesla,"The Tesla Team, July 2, 2020","Recent reports that we have terminated employees due to their concerns over health practices are fundamentally untrue. The employees quoted in recent stories are still employed with Tesla and we have offered them work multiple times. All we have asked is that our employees talk to us and provide us the details of their own concern so we can do what we can to help find a solution. Tesla has not only offered employees a window of time to stay home no questions asked, but waived our attendance policy for several weeks after we had approval to reopen our factories. In addition, those who have at-risk family members at home received two weeks paid leave through May 31. Tesla also provides 14-day COVID sick leave pay for employees who are quarantined, self-quarantine due to family members who are sick or have tested positive."
The Lowest Price for Home Solar,"The Tesla Team, June 19, 2020","Today we are introducing the lowest-ever cost to go solar in the United States. Our average system size is now one-third less expensive than the industry average and we have recently introduced a lowest-price guarantee.

Accelerating Tesla’s Safety Culture,"Laurie Shelby, VP Environmental, Health & Safety at Tesla, February 4, 2020","At Tesla, we believe safety in our operations is achieved through engagement, education, innovation and continual improvement. That’s why we focus not just on our overall rate of injury, but also on how to prevent individual injuries before they happen."
There is no “unintended acceleration” in Tesla vehicles,"The Tesla Team, January 20, 2020","This petition is completely false and was brought by a Tesla short-seller. We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle's data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed. In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake."
Model X Earns a 5-Star Safety Rating from Euro NCAP,"The Tesla Team, December 4, 2019","Model X made history when it became the first and only SUV to ever receive a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Model 3 Earns the 2019 IIHS TOP SAFETY PICK+ Award,"The Tesla Team, September 18, 2019","We engineer our cars to be the best in the world – in every category. Model 3, our most affordable car yet, is no exception. From the start, we designed it to be among the safest cars ever built, with the goal of getting as many Model 3s on the road as possible to further our mission."
Introducing Tesla Insurance,"The Tesla Team, August 28, 2019","Starting today, we’re launching Tesla Insurance, a competitively priced insurance offering designed to provide Tesla owners with up to 20% lower rates, and in some cases as much as 30%. Tesla Insurance offers comprehensive coverage and claims management to support our customers in California, and it will expand to additional U.S. states in the future."
Introducing Megapack: Utility-Scale Energy Storage,"The Tesla Team, July 29, 2019","Less than two years ago, Tesla built and installed the world’s largest lithium-ion battery in Hornsdale, South Australia, using Tesla Powerpack batteries.

More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners,"The Tesla Team, May 2, 2019","While no car can prevent all accidents, we work every day to make them less likely to occur. The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars’ eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash."
The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther,"The Tesla Team, April 23, 2019","For more than a decade, Tesla engineers have been obsessed with making the world’s most efficient electric vehicles. As a result, Tesla vehicles already travel farther on a single charge than any other production EV on the market. Today, we’re making changes to Model S and Model X that allow them to travel unprecedented distances without needing to recharge, beating our own record for the longest-range production EVs on the road. And we’ve accomplished this without increasing the cars’ battery size, proving that our expertise in system-level design can make our cars dramatically more efficient."
Sustainable Products and Manufacturing,"The Tesla Team, April 15, 2019","Today, we’re publishing our first ever Impact Report, which measures the impact our products and operations have on the environment and our communities. We believe the faster the world moves towards a zero-emission future, the better, so we’re working hard to minimize our greenhouse gas footprint, while investing in our employees and the communities in which we operate. We look forward to sharing further progress in future reports."
An Update to Our Vehicle Lineup,"The Tesla Team, April 11, 2019","Model 3 has been the best-selling premium car in the U.S. for the past three quarters, and we’ve heard from Model 3 owners around the world that they love their cars.

Introducing a More Seamless Navigate on Autopilot,"The Tesla Team, April 3, 2019","Since we first introduced Navigate on Autopilot last year, Tesla drivers have traveled more than 66 million miles using the feature, and more than 9 million suggested lane changes have been successfully executed with the feature in use. We’ve heard from our customers that it makes road trips and highway driving more relaxing, enjoyable and fun, and gives them an easy way to follow their car’s navigation guidance when traveling on an unfamiliar route."
Tesla’s New Customer Referral Program,"The Tesla Team, March 21, 2019","Customer referrals have been a key part of our growth ever since we began selling Roadster in 2008. Since then, our customers’ enthusiasm for their vehicles has propelled Model 3 to become the best-selling luxury car in the U.S. and the best-selling electric vehicle in the world last year. We’ve heard from our customers that the Referral Program was one of their favorite reasons to tell their friends about Tesla, so today, we’re introducing an all-new Referral Program to give customers another way to share what they love about their cars."
Update on Tesla Stores and Pricing,"The Tesla Team, March 10, 2019","Last month, we announced that we would be winding down many of our stores and moving to online-only sales in order to pass the savings along to our customers."
Introducing V3 Supercharging,"The Tesla Team, March 6, 2019","Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. However, in order to drive continued electric vehicle adoption and further accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, charging needs to be even faster, and the number of vehicles able to charge at a location in a day needs to be significantly higher.

Although lower in cost, it is built to achieve the same perfect 5-star safety rating as the longer-ranged version, which has the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the U.S. Government."
Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla,"The Tesla Team, February 13, 2019","According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. To further enhance the security of our vehicles and give our customers additional peace of mind, today we’re starting to roll out a new safeguard – Sentry Mode – to protect against break-ins and theft."
Company Update,"January 18, 2019","This morning, the following email was sent to all Tesla employees:



As we all experienced first-hand, last year was the most challenging in Tesla’s history. However, thanks to your efforts, 2018 was also the most successful year in Tesla’s history: we delivered almost as many cars as we did in all of 2017 in the last quarter alone and nearly as many cars last year as we did in all the prior years of Tesla’s existence combined! Model 3 also became the best-selling premium vehicle of 2018 in the US. This is truly remarkable and something that few thought possible just a short time ago."
Tesla Welcomes Larry Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson as New Independent Directors To Its Board,"The Tesla Team, December 28, 2018","We are excited to announce that Larry Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson have joined Tesla’s Board of Directors.

"Full $7,500 Federal EV Tax Credit Expires in Under Two Weeks","December 20, 2018","The full $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla customers ends in less than two weeks, and we’re doing everything we can to try to ensure those who order a vehicle today can take delivery by December 31st and take advantage of the savings. To help ensure vehicles are available, we’ve released all our fleet vehicles – like those used for test drives – and vehicles where the original customer can’t take delivery by the end of the year. Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy – and to do that, we need to get as many electric vehicles on the road as quickly as possible, which is why we are working around the clock to meet demand before the end of the year."
How Track Mode Works,"The Tesla Team, November 8, 2018","Electric powertrains have numerous advantages over internal combustion engines. In addition to low cost of ownership, energy efficiency, and near silence, they also offer unparalleled responsiveness. Since the introduction of Tesla Roadster in 2008, we’ve exploited the immediate availability of motor power and torque to achieve unprecedented straight-line performance, making the car’s forward acceleration a pure extension of the driver. With Track Mode, which is designed specifically for use on closed autocross circuits and racetracks, our goal was simple: use that same motor power and torque to make cornering on the track feel just as natural as forward acceleration."
Announcing Robyn Denholm as Tesla’s New Board Chair,"Tesla's Board of Directors, November 7, 2018","Tesla’s Board of Directors is pleased to announce that Robyn Denholm has been appointed as Chair of the Tesla Board, effective immediately. So that she will be able to devote her full attention to the Tesla Chair role, Robyn will be leaving her role as CFO and Head of Strategy at Telstra, Australia’s largest telecommunications company, once her six-month notice period with Telstra is complete. Robyn will be serving as Tesla Chair on a full-time basis."

One Year In: Tesla Safety Update,"Laurie Shelby, VP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), October 26, 2018","Last October, I joined Tesla to oversee its Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) team. Reporting directly to Elon and regularly meeting with him, I’ve enjoyed Tesla’s full support as I expanded the company’s global EHS team to 250 employees, adding 35 people at the Fremont factory alone. Over the past year, it’s been clear to me that nothing is more important to Tesla than the health and well-being of its employees. We are the largest manufacturer in the state of California, and while other U.S. auto manufacturers continue to outsource skilled jobs and safety standards, Tesla is creating and keeping more jobs right here in the United States, allowing us to control quality and safety directly. And the result is that our injury rate has continued to trend downward in 2018."
Model 3 achieves the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested by NHTSA,"The Tesla Team, October 7, 2018","Based on the advanced architecture of Model S and Model X, which were previously found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to have the lowest and second lowest probabilities of injury of all cars ever tested, we engineered Model 3 to be the safest car ever built. Now, not only has Model 3 achieved a perfect 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, but NHTSA’s tests also show that it has the lowest probability of injury of all cars the safety agency has ever tested."

Company Update,"September 7, 2018","The following email was just sent to Tesla employees:



First, I’d like to thank you for your incredible efforts and contribution as we enter the final few weeks of this quarter. This is a very exciting time for Tesla, to say the least, and you are the reason for the tremendous progress we’ve made in a relatively short period of time. It is easy to forget that our company was almost unknown 10 years ago and didn’t even exist until after the start of the 21st century!"
Staying Public,"Elon Musk, August 24, 2018","Earlier this month, I announced that I was considering taking Tesla private. As part of the process, it was important to understand whether our current investors believed this would be a good strategic move and whether they would want to participate in a private Tesla."
Update on Taking Tesla Private,"Elon Musk, August 13, 2018","As I announced last Tuesday, I’m considering taking Tesla private because I believe it could be good for our shareholders, enable Tesla to operate at its best, and advance our mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.

Welcoming New Talent to Tesla,"The Tesla Team, May 25, 2018","As we continue our thorough reorganization to ensure Tesla is well prepared for the future, today we’re pleased to announce a number of key hires that we’ve made over the past several weeks."
A Not So Revealing Story,"The Tesla Team, April 16, 2018","We welcome constructive criticism, but those who care about journalistic integrity should strive for the truth above all. Unfortunately, the writers at Reveal have published an article that paints a completely false picture of Tesla and what it is actually like to work here. In our view, what they portray as investigative journalism is in fact an ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization working directly with union supporters to create a calculated disinformation campaign against Tesla. The piece even includes an interview with Worksafe – the same organization that the UAW enlisted to publish a negative report against Tesla last year, and whose board includes labor union officials and advocates."
An Update on Last Week’s Accident,"The Tesla Team, March 30, 2018","Since posting our first update, we have been working as quickly as possible to establish the facts of last week’s accident. Our hearts are with the family and friends who have been affected by this tragedy."
What We Know About Last Week's Accident,"The Tesla Team, March 27, 2018","We were deeply saddened to learn that the driver of a Model X vehicle involved in an accident last Friday passed away. Safety is at the core of everything we do and every decision we make, so the loss of a life in an accident involving a Tesla vehicle is difficult for all of us. Earlier this week, Tesla proactively reached out to the authorities to offer our assistance in investigating."
Becoming the Safest Car Factory in the World,"Laurie Shelby, VP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS), February 4, 2018","When I recently joined Tesla to oversee employee health and safety, I was asked to take a fresh look at every aspect of how we protect our workforce and ensure a safe working environment. I’ve been focused on workplace safety for over 25 years, and I’ve learned that most issues can be solved by listening to employees, using common sense, being proactive, and ensuring there is a culture that values safety. Since I started, I’ve been pleased to see that much of this work is already happening, and although we are not perfect, we’re taking a number of other steps to achieve our goal of having the safest car factory in the world. Here’s what we’re focused on:"
Hotbed of Misinformation,"The Tesla Team, November 14, 2017","Tesla is absolutely against any form of discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment of any kind. When we hear complaints, we take them very seriously, investigate thoroughly and, if proven to be true, take immediate action."
Supercharging Cities,"The Tesla Team, September 11, 2017","It is extremely important for our customers to be able to easily charge their cars. The most convenient way to charge is to plug in overnight at home, and for most people, this is all that is needed. However, for customers who use their car for long distance travel, there is a growing network of Superchargers located along highways on popular driving routes. We have also installed thousands of Destination Charging connectors at hotels, resorts and restaurants that replicate the home charging experience when you’re away from home. Now, as part of our commitment to make Tesla ownership easy for everyone, including those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, we are expanding our Supercharger network into city centers, starting with downtown Chicago and Boston."

Tesla Powerpack to Enable Large Scale Sustainable Energy to South Australia,"The Tesla Team, July 6, 2017","Last September, a 50-year storm damaged critical infrastructure in the state of South Australia, causing a state-wide blackout and leaving 1.7 million residents without electricity. Further blackouts occurred in the heat of the Australian summer in early 2017. In response, the South Australian Government as a leader in renewable energy, looked for a sustainable solution to ensure energy security for all residents, now and into the future, calling for expressions of interest to deploy grid-scale energy storage options with at least 100 megawatts (MW) of capacity."
Tesla Model X the First SUV Ever to Achieve 5-Star Crash Rating in Every Category,"The Tesla Team, June 13, 2017","We engineered Model X to be the safest SUV ever, and today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced that after conducting independent testing, it has awarded Model X a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, making it the first SUV ever to earn the 5-star rating across the board. More than just resulting in a 5-star rating, the data from NHTSA’s testing shows that Model X has the lowest probability of injury of any SUV it has ever tested. In fact, of all the cars NHTSA has ever tested, Model X’s overall probability of injury was second only to Model S."
Creating the Safest Car Factory in the World,"The Tesla Team, May 14, 2017","Earlier this year, the United Automobile Workers (UAW) announced it was attempting to organize workers in Tesla’s Fremont factory.

Meanwhile, Powerwall customers who allow Tesla and the utilities to use their battery when energy demand is highest will not only have home backup power, but will also receive compensation for its use on the grid."
Solar Roof,"The Tesla Team, May 10, 2017","Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to a sustainable energy future by creating products that are so compelling, there is no alternative. Solar energy has always been part of our master plan, and we recognized the need for a roof that is simultaneously affordable, durable, beautiful and integrated with battery storage."
Charging Is Our Priority,"The Tesla Team, April 24, 2017","As Tesla prepares for our first mass-market vehicle and continues to increase our Model S and Model X fleet, we’re making charging an even greater priority.

A Grain of Salt,"The Tesla Team, June 9, 2016","A few things need to be cleared up about the supposed safety of Model S suspensions:



First, there is no safety defect with the suspensions in either the Model S or Model X. Since we own all of our service centers, we are aware of every incident that happens with our customer cars and we are aware of every part that gets replaced. Whenever there is even a potential issue with one of those parts, we investigate fully. This, combined with extensive durability testing, gives us high confidence in our suspensions. With respect to the car that is discussed in the blog post that led to yesterday’s news (more on the blog post below), the suspension ball joint experienced very abnormal rust. We haven’t seen this on any other car, suggesting a very unusual use case. The car had over 70,000 miles on it and its owner lives down such a long dirt road that it required two tow trucks to retrieve the car. (One to get the car to the highway and one to get it from the highway to the service center.) When we got the car, it was caked in dirt."

Tesla All Wheel Drive (Dual Motor) Power and Torque Specifications,"JB Straubel, Chief Technical Officer, September 21, 2015","Attempting to directly correlate horsepower ratings in petroleum burning vehicles to horsepower in an electric vehicle is a difficult challenge. The physics of an electric vehicle propulsion system are very different from a gasoline one. In an EV, electrochemical reactions in the lithium ion cells create electricity. That electricity flows through power electronics that control the voltage and current, then it flows to electromagnets in the motor that create powerful magnetic fields rotating the shaft to turn the wheels. The power required to rotate this shaft has the most correlation to traditional measures of horsepower. However, the chain actually begins in the electrochemical reactions that happen in the battery pack. Depending on the battery's temperature, state of charge and age, the amount of electricity extracted can vary widely."

CARB Must Maintain Pressure to Deliver Pure ZEV's in California,"Ze'ev Drori, President and CEO, August 13, 2008","The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is considering changes to the Zero Emission Vehicle Program (also commonly known as the “ZEV Mandate”). If you’ve seen Who Killed the Electric Car? you have an idea of what the ZEV Mandate is and how its implementation has been challenged and impeded by traditional auto manufacturers for more than a decade.



On March 27th, the Board met in Sacramento to consider CARB Staff recommendations for changes to the Mandate.  During the open hearing, the Board directed the staff to lower the minimum number of pure ZEV’s that the six largest automotive manufacturers are required to deliver in the period from 2012 to 2015 (known as Phase III) by 70% – from 25,000 to a mere 7,500! This is an absurdly low number given the emerging developments in the EV space, not to mention the progress we’ve demonstrated at Tesla Motors specifically.



Following the March 27th hearing, the Board directed the Staff to draft new regulatory language based on the Board’s decisions and then to open that draft language to a 15 day public comment period which opened on July 25th.Tesla Motors strongly disagrees with the Board’s decision, and with the Staff’s interpretation of that decision with regard to the Phase III minimum. We also object to other key provisions in the revised mandate as proposed by the staff. On August 11th, 2008, Ze’ev sent the letter below to outline Tesla’s position directly to CARB Chairperson Mary Nichols.

European Vacation (Not),"Darryl Siry, Vice President of Sales, Marketing, and Service, May 5, 2008",As I fly back from Brussels and think about the last 9 days in Europe I am very encouraged by what we learned. One of the advantages of a startup operation is the ability to change direction and make decisions very quickly to adjust to the opportunities and risks that present themselves. The flip side of that is that you often need to lead with your chin and accept the fact that you aren’t always entering the battle with your plans all in place. You become a master of rapid prototyping.

Pixels and Polygons,"David Vespremi, October 4, 2007","So there it was. With a strange sense of accomplishment, I took it all in. The silver Roadster’s windshield was smashed, spider web cracks fanning out in all directions from under the mono-wiper. Along the driver’s side of the car, from nose to tail, the paint had been scraped away by what only could only have been severe contact with a concrete barrier. Checking out the passenger’s side, the damage was just as bad.



Smiling, I responded, “this is great!” and took a moment to reflect on how we got to this point. For those expecting a crash test blog entry outlining the rigors of safety certification, I’m sorry to disappoint. The same can be said for those hoping to read of a track testing catastrophe."

Inside the Energy Debate,"Diarmuid O'Connell, Vice President of Business Development, July 18, 2007","If you’ve been listening to the news or reading the headlines from Washington D.C. of late, you’ve no doubt heard a lot about the recent energy debate on Capitol Hill. We’ve been right in the middle of it, and I thought it would be useful to get you folks up to speed on events from our perspective."
The Magic of Tesla Roadster Regenerative Braking,"Greg Solberg, Firmware Engineer, June 29, 2007","In a battery-powered electric vehicle, regenerative braking (also called regen) is the conversion of the vehicle’s kinetic energy into chemical energy stored in the battery, where it can be used later to drive the vehicle. It is braking because it also serves to slow the vehicle. It is regenerative because the energy is recaptured in the battery where it can be used again."
Driving Dynamics - Part 2,"David Vespremi, June 12, 2007","In the last installment of the driving dynamics blog, we explored the interplay between static mass distribution and power delivery in the Tesla Roadster. That’s a complicated way of saying that we looked at how the Tesla Roadster drives based on two key parameters: its chassis architecture (mid-“engine,” rear wheel drive) and power delivery characteristics (extremely broad, flat torque curve). By way of a quick refresher on the subject, the Tesla Roadster maintains the bulk of its mass, the battery pack, ahead of the rear axle and delivers its power to the rear wheels in a linear fashion.



Now let's look at some of the further intricacies of weight and driving dynamics."
High CARB Diet,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, May 29, 2007","Last Thursday I participated in a panel at the Future in Review (FiRE) conference in San Diego, Calif. Very cool – I got to meet one of my heroes: iRobot founder Helen Greiner. (My own Master’s thesis at the University of Illinois was in robotics.) Helen took a ride in the Tesla Roadster and came away with a big smile."
Electric Pink Bunny Slippers,"Greg Solberg, Firmware Engineer, May 17, 2007","A Senior Director of Engineering at work never specifically said that she would cause me bodily harm if I did not write a blog entry about my bunny slippers. So I wrote, “They are size 7-½ fluffy pinks with big ears and little, white puffy tails, and I really like them.” She said that I should consider elaborating. She also never specifically pulled out an instrument of destruction."
Miles of Progress,"Andrew Simpson, Vehicle Systems Engineer, May 10, 2007","They call me “the range guy” at Tesla Motors, which is fitting since it’s my job to characterize and improve the driving range of the Tesla Roadster. This means I get to:



Conduct official range testing according to EPA/CARB procedures,

Work with our development teams to extract the most miles out of the car,

...and best of all...

Spend lots of time driving the Engineering Prototypes (EPs) and Validation Prototypes (VPs) to collect data to calibrate our simulation models and understand real-world range.



It’s a dream job, but it also has its challenges."
On Tour Part Two - Inside the Beltway,"Diarmuid O'Connell, Vice President of Business Development, May 4, 2007","You may not be aware, but for the past six months Tesla Motors has been very busy in Washington, D.C. As with our consumer marketing efforts, we’ve been trying to get the word out to key influencers in the nation’s capital that there is a company in California that’s applying good-old-American ingenuity to address the twin crises of global warming and foreign oil dependence."
Mr. Tesla Goes to Washington,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, May 3, 2007","Yesterday was my first experience testifying before a Senate subcommittee – this one was called the Hearing on Advanced Technology Vehicles: The Road Ahead, before the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure."
The Perfect Tesla Store,"Elon Musk, Co-Founder & CEO of Tesla Motors, April 30, 2007","If you asked people to rate whether they thought their car dealership was a good or bad place to visit, the response would be overwhelmingly bad."
Range Reality,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, April 18, 2007","As you may have read in previous blogs, we recently built our first couple of Validation Prototypes (VPs). These cars represent a significant step forward toward production as they implement numerous corrections to issues discovered during safety and durability testing of the Evaluation Prototypes (EPs), are built from hard-tooled components for all body panels, include production headlights, taillights, and interior components (including much more comfortable seats), and many other subtle changes."
On Tour with the Tesla Roadster,"David Vespremi, April 16, 2007","The Tesla Motors Team is on the road to the Midwest and East Coast for our 2007 Spring Tour. While we will not have an official Tesla Tour T-Shirt (as good as that sounds, it has probably been done before by some folks that don’t look much like us), we can offer something a bit different: a day-by-day account of the trials and tribulations of life on the road and a companion photo album. In this travel diary of sorts, you’ll hear the good, bad, and ugly as the Tesla Motors Team embarks on our most ambitious customer outreach effort to date – hitting four major metropolitan markets in the span of just a few short weeks. So tune in and see the drama unfold here."
Driving Dynamics,"David Vespremi, April 6, 2007","It doesn’t matter where we were going, on which freeway on-ramp we were merging, or even how fast the car was actually traveling. All that matters is that I was driving, I had a journalist riding shotgun, and I was just passing the imaginary apex of a decreasing radius turn with speed to spare. A lot of speed to spare. Oh, and there was a very solid looking concrete barrier occupying pretty much all of the real estate just ahead of the Tesla Roadster’s short red snout.



And then it happened…"
Slip-Sliding Away,"Iain Morrison, Test & Validation Engineer, April 3, 2007","To ensure that the Tesla Roadster is as safe as possible in extreme conditions, we have just finished putting one of our Engineering Prototypes through an extensive test schedule at the Continental Proving Ground in Arvidsjaur, Sweden. The proving ground is in a beautiful location on and around a frozen lake about 60 miles from the Arctic Circle."
The EV Experience,"Stephen Casner, Fellow, Packet Design, March 28, 2007","Stephen Casner spent 25 years working on protocols and systems for transmission of audio and video over packet networks, starting before the Internet existed and continuing through the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE). He was recruited to the Silicon Valley to work with startup Precept Software and its IP/TV product, which was later acquired by Cisco. He is currently a Fellow at Packet Design, working on route analytics, and waiting patiently for his Signature One Hundred number to be called.



I’ve been driving production electric vehicles since November, 1998, when I took delivery of a General Motors EV1. I lost that first-generation EV1 when it was recalled in March 2000, but two months later I was able to lease a Gen 2 EV1 with NiMH batteries. GM pried that one out of my fingers when the three-year lease was up. I managed to continue driving electric by leasing a Ford Ranger EV pickup, but again that was only for a year before it was taken back. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to lease or buy one of the last few 2003 Toyota RAV4-EVs. Given the EV1 lease experience, the choice to purchase was obvious!"
Tesla Roadster Progress - From EP to VP,"Malcolm Powell, Vice President, Vehicle Integration, March 22, 2007","We've just achieved a significant milestone on our road to Tesla Roadster production. Our first Validation Prototype was assembled at the Hethel facility in the U.K. and was recently airlifted to our San Carlos, Calif., workshop to commence system testing."
Energy,"Jon Mittelhauser, Roadster Owner, February 21, 2007","Jon Mittelhauser is one of the early developers of the World Wide Web. As a Master’s student at the University of Illinois, he co-wrote the first widely used web browser, NCSA Mosaic, and helped to define many of the earliest web protocols. Upon earning his Master’s degree for the work on Mosaic, he left the university and became one of the founders of Netscape Communications. Since Netscape he has worked for various startups (some successful and some not!). He currently spends his time as a dad, angel investor, and consultant for early stage companies. He also admits to spending a fair amount of time daydreaming about the Tesla Roadster, which he already has on order…"
Cut From A Different Cloth,"Barrie Dickinison, Director of Body Engineering, February 15, 2007","From the earliest days of our work developing the Tesla Roadster’s body, we realized we had several major challenges on our hands. We had to achieve a low level of aerodynamic drag to increase efficiency, and we had to keep our mass down in order to maintain a high power-to-weight ratio and achieve maximum acceleration. Equally important was our imperative to create a body style for the Tesla Roadster that made people desperately want the car - irrespective of its efficiency or level of performance."
Powering the Tesla Roadster with 'Green' Electrons,"Dr. Rob Wilder, CEO of WilderShares LLC, January 31, 2007","Dr. Rob Wilder is CEO of WilderShares LLC and manager of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, the first Index/Fund on Wall Street for renewable energy, better energy efficiency, and zero-carbon solutions. He is also a Lecturer at University of California, San Diego, and was previously on faculty at University of California, Santa Barbara, and University of Massachusetts. Dr. Wilder has been an AAAS/ EPA Fellow in Environmental Science & Technology, Fulbright Fellow, and National Academy of Sciences Young Investigator."
Vintage Oil and Other Hare-Brained Ideas,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, January 24, 2007","Let me start off by apologizing to Dr. Robert Wilder, one of our customers who was slated to post here this week. You will hear from him next week, but today I want to comment on President Bush’s State of the Union speech."
Auto Show Happenings,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, January 17, 2007","You’ve probably noticed that I’ve been away from the blog for a while. I’ve been a bit busy lately, but I knew you would enjoy reading other perspectives from the Tesla Motors staff.



Tesla Motors is definitely a cast of characters – passionate about our mission, strong opinions, interesting backgrounds. I have never before worked with such an amazing team. I hope you enjoyed meeting a few of them – you will meet more in later blogs.



As you know, we showed the Tesla Roadster in Yokohama’s booth at the L.A. Auto Show. We did not bring the car to the Detroit Auto Show, though several of us attended.



Alternative fueled vehicles were definitely the hot topic at both the L.A. Auto Show and the Detroit Auto Show. Every major manufacturer was bragging about their newest direction for alternative fueled vehicles, and the governors of both California and Michigan already knew all about Tesla Motors when I met them."
Induction Versus DC Brushless Motors,"Wally Rippel, Principal Power Electronics Engineer, January 9, 2007","Wally Rippel is a long-time proponent of electric vehicles. Prior to joining Tesla Motors, he was an engineer at AeroVironment, where he helped develop the EV1 for General Motors and was featured in the documentary movie, Who Killed the Electric Car? Wally has also worked for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on electric vehicle battery research, among other projects. In 1968, as a Caltech undergraduate student, he built an electric car (a converted 1958 Volkswagen microbus) and won the Great Transcontinental Electric Car Race against MIT.



One Size Does Not Fit All

In that odious world of gas powered vehicles, engines are not all alike. There are flat-heads, Hemis, straight, opposed, and V configurations. And on and on. One would have thought that, years ago, someone would have figured out which was best. That would have ended all the choices and thereafter only the one best engine type would be in production. Not so. There is no one best engine type, rather there are different types of engines to suit personal requirements, such as price and performance. This is also true for electric vehicle drives."
"The Perfect Car, Enemy of the Good Car","Jon Faiz Kayyem, Managing Partner of Efficacy Capital Ltd, December 27, 2006","Jon Faiz Kayyem, PhD, is a Managing Partner of Efficacy Capital, which manages a biotech public equities fund. He previously founded Clinical Micro Sensors, now an operating subsidiary of U.K.-based Osmetech. The firm uses advanced electronics and biochemistry to create electronic detectors of specific DNA sequences. Since 1997, Dr. Kayyem has been awarded 31 U.S. patents in nucleic acid detection technology. He serves on the board of several privately-held startup businesses and has produced two documentary films. Dr. Kayyem reserved one of the first 100 Tesla Roadsters and in this week's blog explains why he will never buy another gasoline-powered vehicle.



""The perfect is the enemy of the good."" Voltaire said something like that, and I think about it often when making ""think"" versus ""act"" decisions. For example, should I buy a 60-inch plasma screen or wait and see what comes next?



But how about the bigger question that has bugged me for a while: Should I switch to alternatively-fueled vehicles or wait and see what comes next? I was definitely in waiting mode until one day in 2004 when I saw Al Gore give his Inconvenient Truth slide show. I left the presentation vowing not to buy another gasoline-powered car, a vow that now has me owning a biodiesel Volkswagen and on the list to receive one of the first 100 Tesla Roadsters."
Blowing Hot and Cold,"Brian Randall, Test and Validation Manager, December 20, 2006","Editor's note: Our last blog, Good Vibrations, chronicled some of the safety and durability tests we've been running on the Tesla Roadster. It prompted a number of questions, particularly related to climate control. So we convinced Brian, who is fully booked during regular business hours overseeing the tests, to postpone his holiday shopping a little longer and spend some time after work explaining in more detail how we ensure satisfying climate control in the Tesla Roadster. Here are his thoughts…"
Good Vibrations,"Tesla Motors, Senior Director of Engineering, December 13, 2006","Imagine yourself strapped into a Tesla Roadster speeding down a rough cobblestone path intended to cause so much agitation that the ride stops being fun and starts becoming more like work. It's just a typical day at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA), an engineering and testing facility where we are punishing two of our Tesla Roadster Engineering Prototypes (and several of our engineers as well!)."
Auto Show Mania,"Mike Harrigan, Vice President, Customer Service & Support, December 6, 2006","Tesla Motors wasn't planning to attend an auto show this year. We had a simple marketing plan: viral marketing, public relations, and a great website. But a sequence of extraordinary events changed everything."
A Bit About Batteries,"Martin Eberhard, November 30, 2006","By now most people know that the Tesla Roadster is powered by Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries. But here are a few things about our batteries you might not have heard. Our battery system – or Energy Storage System, as we like to call it – is comprised of 6,831 individual Li-ion cells. It's roughly the size of a storage trunk and weighs about 900 pounds. Nestled securely in the back of the Tesla Roadster, the battery system is the secret behind our four second 0-60 mph acceleration and phenomenal driving range. To achieve this kind of performance, we were meticulous about our battery technology selection. Batteries are not perfect – no doubt about it. Though market forces continue to drive improvements in batteries, the Li-ion battery system in the Tesla Roadster represents the very best of today's commercially available battery technology. These Li-ion batteries are a whole lot better than Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) cells and lead acid cells found in EVs of yore, but they too have their limitations. One of the most difficult challenges in battery design is increasing energy density while also maximizing battery life span. Li-ion chemistries have achieved better combinations of these parameters than anything that has come before. Yet there is still a tradeoff between energy and life, even within the family of Li-ion."
Never a Dull Moment,"Lisa Pavey, Senior Director of Engineering, November 22, 2006","At its heart, Tesla Motors is an engineering company. We get invited to a variety of events because of our technical expertise as well as a general interest in what we are doing and how we are doing it. I often get asked what it is like to work at Tesla Motors and to describe some typical problems we solve. Here is my take on those questions, based on my own experience and a swift survey of some of the other engineers."
How I Fell in Love with the Tesla Roadster,"Don Cox, Professor of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, November 15, 2006","Don Cox is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and the Harald Trap Friis distinguished chair at Stanford University. He spent 25 years at Bell Laboratories and Bellcore developing revolutionary technology for what is now referred to as ""cellular phones."" He has served on the board or as an officer of several Silicon Valley public companies and sits on technical advisory boards of many others. In this week’s blog entry, Don explains why he wanted to be among the first customers to receive a Tesla Roadster. (Don, pictured above with his wife, Mary, checks out the Tesla Roadster.)



My wife, Mary, and I were invited to be a “guest blogger” on the Tesla Motors website. This is a big honor for us. It is an easy task because of our high regard for the Tesla Roadster and the people at Tesla Motors.



We have had a long-standing interest in electric cars because of their potential both to help reduce our country’s dependence on foreign oil and to save our environment from pollution emitted by cars that use internal combustion engines. We thought you might be interested in our experiences and investigations in becoming Signature One Hundred members, the group that has reserved the first Tesla Roadsters to come off the production line. Our story might be called, “How we fell in love with the Tesla Roadster and Tesla Motors.”"
The Tesla Roadster Experience: Quick and Considerate,"Rick Vieth, Director of Product Marketing, November 8, 2006",How fast is it? That’s a common question we get at events where the Tesla Roadster is on display.
Battery Powered Cars – They’re Not Just for Kids Anymore,"Bob Bressler, Owner of Bressler Vinyards, November 1, 2006","Bob Bressler is a customer of Tesla Motors and owner of Bressler Vineyards, a small producer of super-premium Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. An expert in the Internet and networking technologies, Bob’s career prior to becoming a full-time vintner spanned executive positions at Sun Microsystems, 3Com and BBN. We asked Bob to share his perspective on electric cars and the Tesla Roadster.



Why did I order a Tesla Roadster? Believe me, my wife has asked me that question many times. I guess there is no single reason – but a long list of them."
Nikola Tesla Everywhere,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, October 25, 2006","I’m taking a break from answering questions to tell you things about Nikola Tesla that piled on me this week. But before I start, here are a few quick answers:"
Motor City,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, October 18, 2006","A bit about motors, magnets, AC and DC, and weird little widgets called IGBTs, all the while trying to answer some more of your questions. (And yes, we are opening a Detroit office, but that’s another story.)"
Electric Cars and Photovoltaic Solar Cells,"Elon Musk, Co-Founder & CEO of Tesla Motors, October 11, 2006","Elon and Martin both recognize the synergy between solar panels and electric cars. As Martin pointed out to Gov. Schwarzenegger, a million solar rooftops in California will not reduce California’s oil dependency by one drop unless we have electric cars also."
Safety first - ouch!,"Malcom Powell, Vice President, Vehicle Integration, October 3, 2006","This blog continues to attract some fascinating questions and perceptions regarding the philosophies of energy consumption, alternative fuels, well-to-wheel efficiency and other significant issues that affect us all. Then there’s the technology of the car itself with its lithium ion battery pack, onboard charging system, power electronics to handle the immense energy available and that little motor that blasts you towards the horizon at warp speed……Linking all these systems and their safety monitors involves more computing power than the combined total on board all the cars I’ve ever owned. You could probably add your total in too!



So, apart from the new high tech stuff, what else do we do at Tesla Motors to ensure that our customers can enjoy this unique offering?"
"Hybrids, Plug-in or Otherwise","Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, September 27, 2006","Many of you have asked me about hybrid technologies, forcing me to gather my thoughts on the subject. Let me start off by drawing a clean distinction between today’s hybrids (like the Prius), and “Plug-in Hybrids” as proposed by James Woolsey and others."
Balance,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, September 14, 2006",Many of you have asked me about several alternative technologies and why they are not used in the Tesla Roadster. These technologies range from other existing battery technologies (e.g. lithium iron phosphate) to technologies that are on the horizon (e.g. ultracapacitors) to impossible technologies that ultimately boil down to perpetual motion. I will try to address as many of these questions as I can this week.
"Ethanol, Ethanol Everywhere, Time to Stop and Think","Elon Musk, Co-Founder & CEO of Tesla Motors, September 6, 2006","Editor's Note: As our Blog has taken off in popularity, we've come to realize the informal style of a blog isn't the most responsible place to convey something as important as our most up-to-date information on battery safety. Thanks in part to our conversations with you in the blog, we have released several updates to the website with many more details on battery safety -- an issue we take very seriously. Please check out the new whitepaper, new FAQ questions and safety page.

Ethanol (a.k.a. alcohol) will certainly grow as a business and serve as a partial solution to our energy problem, particularly given that it is now taking the place of the gasoline additive MTBE. However, even if large-scale cellulosic ethanol technology is perfected, I don't believe it can become the primary solution to the world's energy needs."
A Glimpse of the Future at a Celebration of the Past,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, August 24, 2006","I know, I know. There are at least a dozen good topics from all your responses for this week’s blog. But I can’t help it – we had such a great time at the Concours d’Elegance at Pebble Beach this weekend that I have to tell you about it."
The Future of Cars is Electric,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, August 16, 2006","Not too long from now, most cars will be electric. Why? Two reasons: because electric cars are far more efficient than any other kind of car, and because they are the ultimate multi-fuel cars. Sound bold, maybe crazy? Read on."
One Brick at a Time,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, August 9, 2006","I continue to be blown away by the number and breadth of responses to our blog. Thank you and keep them coming! Once again, I can’t possibly answer every question, but I will try to answer a few more today."
The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me),"Elon Musk, Co-Founder & CEO of Tesla Motors, August 2, 2006","Background: My day job is running a space transportation company called SpaceX, but on the side I am the chairman of Tesla Motors and help formulate the business and product strategy with Martin and the rest of the team. I have also been Tesla Motor's primary funding source from when the company was just three people and a business plan."
Lotus Position,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, July 25, 2006","Holy smokes! There is no way I can respond to all your comments, but thank you everyone for writing. This time I will discuss one common thread that many of you raised: what exactly is Tesla’s relationship with Lotus? Along the way, I will address a few other threads from your feedback. Once again, I am writing without Marketing’s filters, so I apologize in advance for any “pc” slips."
Attitude,"Martin Eberhard, Co-founder of Tesla Motors, July 19, 2006","Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Tesla Motors blog. This is my space to comment without marketing filters. I have quite a few subjects I want to talk about over the next several months, but I will also look to you, my readers, for suggestions and ideas for future topics.
