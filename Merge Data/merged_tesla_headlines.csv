Attitude,2006-07-19,"Welcome to the inaugural edition of the Tesla Motors blog. This is my space to comment without marketing filters. I have quite a few subjects I want to talk about over the next several months, but I will also look to you, my readers, for suggestions and ideas for future topics. I expect this to be a lively conversation.



Today, I will talk about what we are doing here at Tesla, and why it is different than any car company that has come before."
Lotus Position,2006-07-25,"Holy smokes! There is no way I can respond to all your comments, but thank you everyone for writing. This time I will discuss one common thread that many of you raised: what exactly is Tesla’s relationship with Lotus? Along the way, I will address a few other threads from your feedback. Once again, I am writing without Marketing’s filters, so I apologize in advance for any “pc” slips."
The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me),2006-08-02,"Background: My day job is running a space transportation company called SpaceX, but on the side I am the chairman of Tesla Motors and help formulate the business and product strategy with Martin and the rest of the team. I have also been Tesla Motor's primary funding source from when the company was just three people and a business plan."
One Brick at a Time,2006-08-09,"I continue to be blown away by the number and breadth of responses to our blog. Thank you and keep them coming! Once again, I can’t possibly answer every question, but I will try to answer a few more today."
The Future of Cars is Electric,2006-08-16,"Not too long from now, most cars will be electric. Why? Two reasons: because electric cars are far more efficient than any other kind of car, and because they are the ultimate multi-fuel cars. Sound bold, maybe crazy? Read on."
A Glimpse of the Future at a Celebration of the Past,2006-08-24,"I know, I know. There are at least a dozen good topics from all your responses for this week’s blog. But I can’t help it – we had such a great time at the Concours d’Elegance at Pebble Beach this weekend that I have to tell you about it."
"Ethanol, Ethanol Everywhere, Time to Stop and Think",2006-09-06,"Editor's Note: As our Blog has taken off in popularity, we've come to realize the informal style of a blog isn't the most responsible place to convey something as important as our most up-to-date information on battery safety. Thanks in part to our conversations with you in the blog, we have released several updates to the website with many more details on battery safety -- an issue we take very seriously. Please check out the new whitepaper, new FAQ questions and safety page.

Ethanol (a.k.a. alcohol) will certainly grow as a business and serve as a partial solution to our energy problem, particularly given that it is now taking the place of the gasoline additive MTBE. However, even if large-scale cellulosic ethanol technology is perfected, I don't believe it can become the primary solution to the world's energy needs."
Balance,2006-09-14,Many of you have asked me about several alternative technologies and why they are not used in the Tesla Roadster. These technologies range from other existing battery technologies (e.g. lithium iron phosphate) to technologies that are on the horizon (e.g. ultracapacitors) to impossible technologies that ultimately boil down to perpetual motion. I will try to address as many of these questions as I can this week.
"Hybrids, Plug-in or Otherwise",2006-09-27,"Many of you have asked me about hybrid technologies, forcing me to gather my thoughts on the subject. Let me start off by drawing a clean distinction between today’s hybrids (like the Prius), and “Plug-in Hybrids” as proposed by James Woolsey and others."
Safety first - ouch!,2006-10-03,"This blog continues to attract some fascinating questions and perceptions regarding the philosophies of energy consumption, alternative fuels, well-to-wheel efficiency and other significant issues that affect us all. Then there’s the technology of the car itself with its lithium ion battery pack, onboard charging system, power electronics to handle the immense energy available and that little motor that blasts you towards the horizon at warp speed……Linking all these systems and their safety monitors involves more computing power than the combined total on board all the cars I’ve ever owned. You could probably add your total in too!



So, apart from the new high tech stuff, what else do we do at Tesla Motors to ensure that our customers can enjoy this unique offering?"
Electric Cars and Photovoltaic Solar Cells,2006-10-11,"Elon and Martin both recognize the synergy between solar panels and electric cars. As Martin pointed out to Gov. Schwarzenegger, a million solar rooftops in California will not reduce California’s oil dependency by one drop unless we have electric cars also."
Motor City,2006-10-18,"A bit about motors, magnets, AC and DC, and weird little widgets called IGBTs, all the while trying to answer some more of your questions. (And yes, we are opening a Detroit office, but that’s another story.)"
Nikola Tesla Everywhere,2006-10-25,"I’m taking a break from answering questions to tell you things about Nikola Tesla that piled on me this week. But before I start, here are a few quick answers:"
Battery Powered Cars – They’re Not Just for Kids Anymore,2006-11-01,"Bob Bressler is a customer of Tesla Motors and owner of Bressler Vineyards, a small producer of super-premium Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. An expert in the Internet and networking technologies, Bob’s career prior to becoming a full-time vintner spanned executive positions at Sun Microsystems, 3Com and BBN. We asked Bob to share his perspective on electric cars and the Tesla Roadster.



Why did I order a Tesla Roadster? Believe me, my wife has asked me that question many times. I guess there is no single reason – but a long list of them."
The Tesla Roadster Experience: Quick and Considerate,2006-11-08,How fast is it? That’s a common question we get at events where the Tesla Roadster is on display.
How I Fell in Love with the Tesla Roadster,2006-11-15,"Don Cox is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and the Harald Trap Friis distinguished chair at Stanford University. He spent 25 years at Bell Laboratories and Bellcore developing revolutionary technology for what is now referred to as ""cellular phones."" He has served on the board or as an officer of several Silicon Valley public companies and sits on technical advisory boards of many others. In this week’s blog entry, Don explains why he wanted to be among the first customers to receive a Tesla Roadster. (Don, pictured above with his wife, Mary, checks out the Tesla Roadster.)



My wife, Mary, and I were invited to be a “guest blogger” on the Tesla Motors website. This is a big honor for us. It is an easy task because of our high regard for the Tesla Roadster and the people at Tesla Motors.



We have had a long-standing interest in electric cars because of their potential both to help reduce our country’s dependence on foreign oil and to save our environment from pollution emitted by cars that use internal combustion engines. We thought you might be interested in our experiences and investigations in becoming Signature One Hundred members, the group that has reserved the first Tesla Roadsters to come off the production line. Our story might be called, “How we fell in love with the Tesla Roadster and Tesla Motors.”"
Never a Dull Moment,2006-11-22,"At its heart, Tesla Motors is an engineering company. We get invited to a variety of events because of our technical expertise as well as a general interest in what we are doing and how we are doing it. I often get asked what it is like to work at Tesla Motors and to describe some typical problems we solve. Here is my take on those questions, based on my own experience and a swift survey of some of the other engineers."
A Bit About Batteries,2006-11-30,"By now most people know that the Tesla Roadster is powered by Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries. But here are a few things about our batteries you might not have heard. Our battery system – or Energy Storage System, as we like to call it – is comprised of 6,831 individual Li-ion cells. It's roughly the size of a storage trunk and weighs about 900 pounds. Nestled securely in the back of the Tesla Roadster, the battery system is the secret behind our four second 0-60 mph acceleration and phenomenal driving range. To achieve this kind of performance, we were meticulous about our battery technology selection. Batteries are not perfect – no doubt about it. Though market forces continue to drive improvements in batteries, the Li-ion battery system in the Tesla Roadster represents the very best of today's commercially available battery technology. These Li-ion batteries are a whole lot better than Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) cells and lead acid cells found in EVs of yore, but they too have their limitations. One of the most difficult challenges in battery design is increasing energy density while also maximizing battery life span. Li-ion chemistries have achieved better combinations of these parameters than anything that has come before. Yet there is still a tradeoff between energy and life, even within the family of Li-ion."
Auto Show Mania,2006-12-06,"Tesla Motors wasn't planning to attend an auto show this year. We had a simple marketing plan: viral marketing, public relations, and a great website. But a sequence of extraordinary events changed everything."
Good Vibrations,2006-12-13,"Imagine yourself strapped into a Tesla Roadster speeding down a rough cobblestone path intended to cause so much agitation that the ride stops being fun and starts becoming more like work. It's just a typical day at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA), an engineering and testing facility where we are punishing two of our Tesla Roadster Engineering Prototypes (and several of our engineers as well!)."
Blowing Hot and Cold,2006-12-20,"Editor's note: Our last blog, Good Vibrations, chronicled some of the safety and durability tests we've been running on the Tesla Roadster. It prompted a number of questions, particularly related to climate control. So we convinced Brian, who is fully booked during regular business hours overseeing the tests, to postpone his holiday shopping a little longer and spend some time after work explaining in more detail how we ensure satisfying climate control in the Tesla Roadster. Here are his thoughts…"
"The Perfect Car, Enemy of the Good Car",2006-12-27,"Jon Faiz Kayyem, PhD, is a Managing Partner of Efficacy Capital, which manages a biotech public equities fund. He previously founded Clinical Micro Sensors, now an operating subsidiary of U.K.-based Osmetech. The firm uses advanced electronics and biochemistry to create electronic detectors of specific DNA sequences. Since 1997, Dr. Kayyem has been awarded 31 U.S. patents in nucleic acid detection technology. He serves on the board of several privately-held startup businesses and has produced two documentary films. Dr. Kayyem reserved one of the first 100 Tesla Roadsters and in this week's blog explains why he will never buy another gasoline-powered vehicle.



""The perfect is the enemy of the good."" Voltaire said something like that, and I think about it often when making ""think"" versus ""act"" decisions. For example, should I buy a 60-inch plasma screen or wait and see what comes next?



But how about the bigger question that has bugged me for a while: Should I switch to alternatively-fueled vehicles or wait and see what comes next? I was definitely in waiting mode until one day in 2004 when I saw Al Gore give his Inconvenient Truth slide show. I left the presentation vowing not to buy another gasoline-powered car, a vow that now has me owning a biodiesel Volkswagen and on the list to receive one of the first 100 Tesla Roadsters."
Induction Versus DC Brushless Motors,2007-01-09,"Wally Rippel is a long-time proponent of electric vehicles. Prior to joining Tesla Motors, he was an engineer at AeroVironment, where he helped develop the EV1 for General Motors and was featured in the documentary movie, Who Killed the Electric Car? Wally has also worked for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on electric vehicle battery research, among other projects. In 1968, as a Caltech undergraduate student, he built an electric car (a converted 1958 Volkswagen microbus) and won the Great Transcontinental Electric Car Race against MIT.



One Size Does Not Fit All

In that odious world of gas powered vehicles, engines are not all alike. There are flat-heads, Hemis, straight, opposed, and V configurations. And on and on. One would have thought that, years ago, someone would have figured out which was best. That would have ended all the choices and thereafter only the one best engine type would be in production. Not so. There is no one best engine type, rather there are different types of engines to suit personal requirements, such as price and performance. This is also true for electric vehicle drives."
Auto Show Happenings,2007-01-17,"You’ve probably noticed that I’ve been away from the blog for a while. I’ve been a bit busy lately, but I knew you would enjoy reading other perspectives from the Tesla Motors staff.



Tesla Motors is definitely a cast of characters – passionate about our mission, strong opinions, interesting backgrounds. I have never before worked with such an amazing team. I hope you enjoyed meeting a few of them – you will meet more in later blogs.



As you know, we showed the Tesla Roadster in Yokohama’s booth at the L.A. Auto Show. We did not bring the car to the Detroit Auto Show, though several of us attended.



Alternative fueled vehicles were definitely the hot topic at both the L.A. Auto Show and the Detroit Auto Show. Every major manufacturer was bragging about their newest direction for alternative fueled vehicles, and the governors of both California and Michigan already knew all about Tesla Motors when I met them."
Vintage Oil and Other Hare-Brained Ideas,2007-01-24,"Let me start off by apologizing to Dr. Robert Wilder, one of our customers who was slated to post here this week. You will hear from him next week, but today I want to comment on President Bush’s State of the Union speech."
Powering the Tesla Roadster with 'Green' Electrons,2007-01-31,"Dr. Rob Wilder is CEO of WilderShares LLC and manager of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, the first Index/Fund on Wall Street for renewable energy, better energy efficiency, and zero-carbon solutions. He is also a Lecturer at University of California, San Diego, and was previously on faculty at University of California, Santa Barbara, and University of Massachusetts. Dr. Wilder has been an AAAS/ EPA Fellow in Environmental Science & Technology, Fulbright Fellow, and National Academy of Sciences Young Investigator."
Cut From A Different Cloth,2007-02-15,"From the earliest days of our work developing the Tesla Roadster’s body, we realized we had several major challenges on our hands. We had to achieve a low level of aerodynamic drag to increase efficiency, and we had to keep our mass down in order to maintain a high power-to-weight ratio and achieve maximum acceleration. Equally important was our imperative to create a body style for the Tesla Roadster that made people desperately want the car - irrespective of its efficiency or level of performance."
Energy,2007-02-21,"Jon Mittelhauser is one of the early developers of the World Wide Web. As a Master’s student at the University of Illinois, he co-wrote the first widely used web browser, NCSA Mosaic, and helped to define many of the earliest web protocols. Upon earning his Master’s degree for the work on Mosaic, he left the university and became one of the founders of Netscape Communications. Since Netscape he has worked for various startups (some successful and some not!). He currently spends his time as a dad, angel investor, and consultant for early stage companies. He also admits to spending a fair amount of time daydreaming about the Tesla Roadster, which he already has on order…"
Tesla Roadster Progress - From EP to VP,2007-03-22,"We've just achieved a significant milestone on our road to Tesla Roadster production. Our first Validation Prototype was assembled at the Hethel facility in the U.K. and was recently airlifted to our San Carlos, Calif., workshop to commence system testing."
The EV Experience,2007-03-28,"Stephen Casner spent 25 years working on protocols and systems for transmission of audio and video over packet networks, starting before the Internet existed and continuing through the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE). He was recruited to the Silicon Valley to work with startup Precept Software and its IP/TV product, which was later acquired by Cisco. He is currently a Fellow at Packet Design, working on route analytics, and waiting patiently for his Signature One Hundred number to be called.



I’ve been driving production electric vehicles since November, 1998, when I took delivery of a General Motors EV1. I lost that first-generation EV1 when it was recalled in March 2000, but two months later I was able to lease a Gen 2 EV1 with NiMH batteries. GM pried that one out of my fingers when the three-year lease was up. I managed to continue driving electric by leasing a Ford Ranger EV pickup, but again that was only for a year before it was taken back. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to lease or buy one of the last few 2003 Toyota RAV4-EVs. Given the EV1 lease experience, the choice to purchase was obvious!"
Slip-Sliding Away,2007-04-03,"To ensure that the Tesla Roadster is as safe as possible in extreme conditions, we have just finished putting one of our Engineering Prototypes through an extensive test schedule at the Continental Proving Ground in Arvidsjaur, Sweden. The proving ground is in a beautiful location on and around a frozen lake about 60 miles from the Arctic Circle."
Driving Dynamics,2007-04-06,"It doesn’t matter where we were going, on which freeway on-ramp we were merging, or even how fast the car was actually traveling. All that matters is that I was driving, I had a journalist riding shotgun, and I was just passing the imaginary apex of a decreasing radius turn with speed to spare. A lot of speed to spare. Oh, and there was a very solid looking concrete barrier occupying pretty much all of the real estate just ahead of the Tesla Roadster’s short red snout.



And then it happened…"
On Tour with the Tesla Roadster,2007-04-16,"The Tesla Motors Team is on the road to the Midwest and East Coast for our 2007 Spring Tour. While we will not have an official Tesla Tour T-Shirt (as good as that sounds, it has probably been done before by some folks that don’t look much like us), we can offer something a bit different: a day-by-day account of the trials and tribulations of life on the road and a companion photo album. In this travel diary of sorts, you’ll hear the good, bad, and ugly as the Tesla Motors Team embarks on our most ambitious customer outreach effort to date – hitting four major metropolitan markets in the span of just a few short weeks. So tune in and see the drama unfold here."
Range Reality,2007-04-18,"As you may have read in previous blogs, we recently built our first couple of Validation Prototypes (VPs). These cars represent a significant step forward toward production as they implement numerous corrections to issues discovered during safety and durability testing of the Evaluation Prototypes (EPs), are built from hard-tooled components for all body panels, include production headlights, taillights, and interior components (including much more comfortable seats), and many other subtle changes."
The Perfect Tesla Store,2007-04-30,"If you asked people to rate whether they thought their car dealership was a good or bad place to visit, the response would be overwhelmingly bad."
Mr. Tesla Goes to Washington,2007-05-03,"Yesterday was my first experience testifying before a Senate subcommittee – this one was called the Hearing on Advanced Technology Vehicles: The Road Ahead, before the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure."
On Tour Part Two - Inside the Beltway,2007-05-04,"You may not be aware, but for the past six months Tesla Motors has been very busy in Washington, D.C. As with our consumer marketing efforts, we’ve been trying to get the word out to key influencers in the nation’s capital that there is a company in California that’s applying good-old-American ingenuity to address the twin crises of global warming and foreign oil dependence."
Miles of Progress,2007-05-10,"They call me “the range guy” at Tesla Motors, which is fitting since it’s my job to characterize and improve the driving range of the Tesla Roadster. This means I get to:



Conduct official range testing according to EPA/CARB procedures,

Work with our development teams to extract the most miles out of the car,

...and best of all...

Spend lots of time driving the Engineering Prototypes (EPs) and Validation Prototypes (VPs) to collect data to calibrate our simulation models and understand real-world range.



It’s a dream job, but it also has its challenges."
Electric Pink Bunny Slippers,2007-05-17,"A Senior Director of Engineering at work never specifically said that she would cause me bodily harm if I did not write a blog entry about my bunny slippers. So I wrote, “They are size 7-½ fluffy pinks with big ears and little, white puffy tails, and I really like them.” She said that I should consider elaborating. She also never specifically pulled out an instrument of destruction."
High CARB Diet,2007-05-29,"Last Thursday I participated in a panel at the Future in Review (FiRE) conference in San Diego, Calif. Very cool – I got to meet one of my heroes: iRobot founder Helen Greiner. (My own Master’s thesis at the University of Illinois was in robotics.) Helen took a ride in the Tesla Roadster and came away with a big smile."
Driving Dynamics - Part 2,2007-06-12,"In the last installment of the driving dynamics blog, we explored the interplay between static mass distribution and power delivery in the Tesla Roadster. That’s a complicated way of saying that we looked at how the Tesla Roadster drives based on two key parameters: its chassis architecture (mid-“engine,” rear wheel drive) and power delivery characteristics (extremely broad, flat torque curve). By way of a quick refresher on the subject, the Tesla Roadster maintains the bulk of its mass, the battery pack, ahead of the rear axle and delivers its power to the rear wheels in a linear fashion.



Now let's look at some of the further intricacies of weight and driving dynamics."
The Magic of Tesla Roadster Regenerative Braking,2007-06-29,"In a battery-powered electric vehicle, regenerative braking (also called regen) is the conversion of the vehicle’s kinetic energy into chemical energy stored in the battery, where it can be used later to drive the vehicle. It is braking because it also serves to slow the vehicle. It is regenerative because the energy is recaptured in the battery where it can be used again."
Inside the Energy Debate,2007-07-18,"If you’ve been listening to the news or reading the headlines from Washington D.C. of late, you’ve no doubt heard a lot about the recent energy debate on Capitol Hill. We’ve been right in the middle of it, and I thought it would be useful to get you folks up to speed on events from our perspective."
The Most Coddled Automotive Battery Ever?,2007-08-08,"We get some great questions and comments from the readers of our blogs, and this post takes its title from Brent, who on May 30 wrote:

“ The Roadster’s battery is arguably the most coddled automotive battery in history. It has its own climate control system, several monitoring computers, and perhaps some other mojo 'they' are not telling us. ”"
Concours d’Elegance – Part Deux,2007-08-24,You can tell a full year has passed since we announced the Tesla Roadster because we’re starting to repeat annual events. Last weekend we participated in the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance for the second time. This is a terrific event held on the grounds of the Pebble Beach golf course each year.
Handing Over the Keys,2007-09-13,"A critical part of the sales, marketing, and service function at Tesla Motors is to help inform product development and engineering decisions based on a customer perspective, a part of what we call “product marketing.”"
Handing Over the Keys II,2007-09-24,"A critical part of the sales, marketing, and service function at Tesla Motors is to help inform product development and engineering decisions based on a customer perspective, a part of what we call “product marketing.” When validation prototype 10 (VP10) was built, one of the things we planned to use it for was to put a lot of miles on the car and provide marketing feedback to engineering teams for final refinements or validation. We recently scheduled rides with some of our customers to expand the feedback loop and asked them to share their driving experiences publicly on this blog. The write-ups are unedited, save for my commentary in [brackets]. The first three can be found here. Read on for two new perspectives."
Where the Rubber Meets the Road,2007-09-24,"When I last posted to this blog in May, the news was a mixed bag. Martin (Founder Martin Eberhard) had just officially revised our range expectations down from 250 miles to greater than 200 miles, but we remained committed to holding the line on 4 second 0-60 mph acceleration and delivering the Tesla Roadster with the performance, handling, looks, and safety of a world-class electric sports car. Now it is September and in the last three weeks we have completed performance and range validation testing of Validation Prototype 1 (VP1 aka “the green car”) in order to verify our Tesla Roadster performance claims. I’m extremely pleased to say that the results are in and our hard work has really paid off!"
Pixels and Polygons,2007-10-04,"So there it was. With a strange sense of accomplishment, I took it all in. The silver Roadster’s windshield was smashed, spider web cracks fanning out in all directions from under the mono-wiper. Along the driver’s side of the car, from nose to tail, the paint had been scraped away by what only could only have been severe contact with a concrete barrier. Checking out the passenger’s side, the damage was just as bad.



Smiling, I responded, “this is great!” and took a moment to reflect on how we got to this point. For those expecting a crash test blog entry outlining the rigors of safety certification, I’m sorry to disappoint. The same can be said for those hoping to read of a track testing catastrophe."
Handing Over the Keys III,2007-10-15,"A critical part of the sales, marketing, and service function at Tesla Motors is to help inform product development and engineering decisions based on a customer perspective, a part of what we call “product marketing.” When validation prototype 10 (VP10) was built, one of the things we planned to use it for was to put a lot of miles on the car and provide marketing feedback to engineering teams for final refinements or validation.

The Evolving Landscape of EVs,2007-10-24,Editor's Note: From today's Wall Street Journal
Handing Over the Keys IV: Michael 'Flea' Balzary,2007-11-06,"Michael ""Flea"" Balzary likes to break new ground. With band mates Red Hot Chili Peppers, he pioneered funk metal, a sound that marries aspects of funk and hip-hop with traditional rock. He applied the same innovative spirit to his ride and now holds a reservation for a 2008 model year Tesla Roadster. In October, as part of our ongoing customer drive program, Michael got behind the wheel of our prototype Tesla Roadster. What follows is his feedback from the driving experience. As always, customer drive opinions are unedited by Tesla Motors."
On the Road with Motor Trend,2007-12-06,"Motor Trend Technical Editor Kim Reynolds joined us for a day of driving Validation Prototypes 9 and 10 on Monday (December 3). Kim is an understated guy, but very knowledgeable about EVs. Kim knew Alec Brooks, Tesla's Director of Vehicle Technologies, from way back and told me stories about “back in the day” when he used to let Alec and Al Cocconi bring the AC Propulsion's t-zero over to the Motor Trend skidpad so he could help them understand how the car should behave on “throttle on” and “throttle off” while turning hard."
The Song Remains the Same,2007-12-21,"Given the recent management changes, some reassurances are in order regarding Tesla Motors' future plans. The near term message is simple and unequivocal - we are going to deliver a great sports car next year that customers will love driving."
A Letter to Customers from Ze'ev Drori,2007-12-27,"The following is a letter that was sent to Tesla Roadster customers on December 21 to review key developments in the Roadster program. These updates were first revealed a week prior in a customer town hall meeting, which was hosted by Chairman Elon Musk and President and CEO Ze'ev Drori at Tesla's corporate office. More than 100 customers attended, either in person or via conference call. As he notes at the end of the letter, Ze'ev plans to contribute more to the Tesla blog in the new year."
50 State Legal,2008-01-24,It has been quite a while since I have put finger tip to key board and joined the Tesla blogosphere. This might have something to do with my being a little bit busy as we have been maturing the Roadster from an amazing prototype to a full-blown production car.
Handing Over the Keys V: Aaron 'p-nut' Wills,2008-02-01,"Aaron 'p-nut' Wills is the bassist and youngest member of the band 311. Known for his “funk-slap” bass style p-nut has brought his own sound and entertaining style to the stage. Aaron had a recent opportunity to drive a Tesla Roadster around Santa Monica and through the hills of Malibu. Following are his impressions from the day:



Santa Monica was misty and I was getting a turn behind the wheel of my dream car."
Smarter Charging,2008-02-05,"Ten years ago when I was driving an EV1, one of the best perks was free parking and charging at LAX. I would pull into one of the EV parking places by Terminal One, plug in, and go on my trip. The charger would turn on right away – typically this would be in the middle of the day – and the battery pack would be fully charged even before my plane had left the ground. When I would return a few days later, typically at night, the battery pack would have partially self-discharged and was cold soaked, having sat for days with the charger connected but off."
Re: P1 Arriving Now! :),2008-02-06,"On Friday, February 1, 2008 at 12:56 P.M., an email was sent to all San Carlos based employees of Tesla Motors: “P1 Arriving Now! :).”



This simple email signified the moment we had been working toward for the last few years. You see, “P1” is the internal designation for the first production unit to be produced by Tesla Motors. This is the anticipated ‘first car’ that was built for Chairman, Elon Musk. So what was it like to be a part of the arrival of P1?



The day started with great anticipation. We all knew the car was planning to arrive on Friday at about 1:00 P.M."
The Evolution of Motor Control: from Waves to Bits,2008-02-11,"When we last discussed motor control on this blog, EP10 was drifting around on the frozen lake in Arvidsjaur, Sweden. At that time (January 2007), we were in the process of co-evaluating Conti-Teves’ ABS system in tandem with Tesla’s motor control. We left the lake thinking highly of the Conti system and moderately pleased with the Roadster’s motor control and traction control algorithms."
Handing Over the Keys VI: Dr. Rob Wilder,2008-02-14,"Dr. Rob Wilder is Manager of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, the first Index on Wall Street for renewable energy, better energy efficiency, and zero-carbon solutions. He was previously on faculty at U.C. Santa Barbara, and University of Massachusetts; he has been a AAAS/EPA Fellow in Environmental Science & Technology, Fulbright Fellow, and National Academy of Sciences Young Investigator."
Lotus Engineering Newsletter Q&A with Tesla's Car Guy,2008-02-20,"In the beginning of January, Tesla Motors Vice President of Vehicle Integration, Mac Powell, sat down with Dave Leggett of just-auto for a Q&A session which recently appeared in the 24th issue of the Lotus Engineering Newsletter, proActive. We wanted to share with you this excerpt from the Newsletter as well as include some comments on recent updates and additional information."
The Spin Stops Here,2008-02-28,"Two weeks ago, I highlighted how Tesla moved from waves to bits in our motor and charge controller in the PEM. You might have left with the impression that as of June 2007, when the DMC replaced the analog controller, our work as DMC firmware engineers was complete. Fortunately for us (this is fun, remember!), that was far from true."
Driving P1,2008-02-29,"On February 1, 2008 Tesla Motors handed over the keys of the first production Roadster (P1) to Elon Musk, Chairman and now a proud Roadster owner. What has life been like behind the wheel of P1? Find out from Elon himself.





It has been a blast driving my Tesla Roadster every day for the past several weeks, using it as my daily driver from Bel Air to Hawthorne. I really think this is the most fun car I've ever owned, beating out the McLaren F1 and my 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo."
Mythbusters Part 2: The Tesla Roadster is not a Converted Lotus Elise,2008-03-03,"One of the more common misconceptions about the Tesla Roadster is that it is an electrified Lotus Elise. This has been an interesting problem to deal with because the Tesla is vastly different from an Elise and it is important that people are aware of this. In fact, we recently counted how many parts the two cars shared and the total number was under 7% by parts count."
Mythbusters Part 3: Recycling our Non-Toxic Battery Packs,2008-03-11,"As I make presentations at various conferences regarding our battery pack, or Energy Storage System (ESS), I’m often asked the question ”Isn’t the battery pack toxic” and whether or not it can be disposed of safely. To reach a wider audience, I thought it best to address these questions in our blog.





Energy Storage System



First, it’s necessary to understand the contents of our ESS."
We have begun regular production of the Tesla Roadster,2008-03-17,"In my last posting on this blog I emphasized that my primary goal as the new CEO of Tesla Motors was to get the car on the road.

Since my previous communication we have obtained all the required regulatory approvals for the sale of the Roadster in the US and delivered the first production Tesla Roadster."
CARB Must Reject Staff Recommendation to Weaken ZEV Mandate,2008-03-24,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is considering changes to the Zero Emission Vehicle Program (also commonly known as the “ZEV Mandate”) on March 27th at its Board meeting in Sacramento. If you’ve seen Who Killed the Electric Car? you have an idea of what the ZEV Mandate is and how its implementation has been challenged and impeded by traditional auto manufacturers for more than a decade.



Tesla Motors strongly disagrees with the recently proposed changes to the ZEV Mandate as reflected in the staff’s “Initial Statement of Reasons” (ISOR) dated February 8, 2008 and is lobbying against the proposed changes. President and CEO Ze’ev Drori will speak at the Board meeting this week to communicate our position directly to the board.



On March 12th, 2008, Ze’ev sent the letter below to outline Tesla’s position directly to CARB Chairperson Mary Nichols. In addition, Tesla developed a whitepaper rebutting the faulty conclusions of the CARB ZEV Expert Panel Position on Lithium Ion Full-Performance Battery Electric Vehicles."
Tesla Launches European Sales,2008-04-08,"Last Wednesday the Financial Times ran a piece indicating that Tesla was now formally setting its sights on Europe. This is the first of what will be an increasing effort on our part to build the Tesla brand on the European continent with the anticipation of delivering cars to customers starting in the middle of 2009.

The idea that Tesla would expand internationally is nothing new – that has been our intention all along. There are many reasons why Europe is a very attractive market, outlined below. The thing that is new here is the timing of our expansion plans."

European Vacation (Not),2008-05-05,As I fly back from Brussels and think about the last 9 days in Europe I am very encouraged by what we learned. One of the advantages of a startup operation is the ability to change direction and make decisions very quickly to adjust to the opportunities and risks that present themselves. The flip side of that is that you often need to lead with your chin and accept the fact that you aren’t always entering the battle with your plans all in place. You become a master of rapid prototyping.

Update on Production and Delivery of Cars to Customers,2008-07-12,"The following update was sent by Ze’ev Drori to Tesla customers yesterday.



You know of course the saying “Good things are worth waiting for” ... undoubtedly we were trying the truism of this adage longer than warranted, but we have broken the logjam. We are delivering the Roadster to our customers. Already 9 production Roadsters have arrived in California, another 3 arrive this weekend, and they will keep arriving at the rate of 4 per week (except for the scheduled factory shut down in the last two weeks of August)."

CARB Must Maintain Pressure to Deliver Pure ZEV's in California,2008-08-13,"The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is considering changes to the Zero Emission Vehicle Program (also commonly known as the “ZEV Mandate”). If you’ve seen Who Killed the Electric Car? you have an idea of what the ZEV Mandate is and how its implementation has been challenged and impeded by traditional auto manufacturers for more than a decade.



On March 27th, the Board met in Sacramento to consider CARB Staff recommendations for changes to the Mandate.  During the open hearing, the Board directed the staff to lower the minimum number of pure ZEV’s that the six largest automotive manufacturers are required to deliver in the period from 2012 to 2015 (known as Phase III) by 70% – from 25,000 to a mere 7,500! This is an absurdly low number given the emerging developments in the EV space, not to mention the progress we’ve demonstrated at Tesla Motors specifically.



Following the March 27th hearing, the Board directed the Staff to draft new regulatory language based on the Board’s decisions and then to open that draft language to a 15 day public comment period which opened on July 25th.Tesla Motors strongly disagrees with the Board’s decision, and with the Staff’s interpretation of that decision with regard to the Phase III minimum. We also object to other key provisions in the revised mandate as proposed by the staff. On August 11th, 2008, Ze’ev sent the letter below to outline Tesla’s position directly to CARB Chairperson Mary Nichols.



If you support Tesla’s position, you can help by calling Board Members or Staff, mailing, or e-mailing the Air Resources Board immediately."

Driving the Tesla Roadster,2008-11-05,"Ben Rosen, venture capitalist and former chairman of Compaq, is one of the most influential personalities in the technology industry. Under his leadership, Compaq Computer became one of the first companies to clone IBM's PC design, enabling Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker in the 1990s.

Less well known is Ben’s history as an automotive pioneer. More than 15 years ago, Ben and his brother Harold (father of the geostationary communications satellite) started a company to build a hybrid-electric powertrain for cars. Rosen Motors hoped to dramatically improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions – without compromising on performance and style. Despite the brothers’ enthusiasm and demonstrations to major automakers, their vehicle was never commercialized.

A Snapshot of the Electric Car on the Electric Grid,2010-01-29,"The Tesla Roadster goes more than 200 miles (380 km) on a single charge. The average person drives about 40 miles (60km) in a day. This leaves a range of about 160 miles (257km) after an average day of driving in a Tesla Roadster. Meaning that at the end of the day when a Roadster is plugged in to be charged up, it is really only to top off the battery.



Why is this significant?



It is important to understand the amount of energy a battery draws when charging and how this affects the electricity grid.



The typical home is allocated 100-200 amps from the neighborhood’s transformer."

The physics of an electric vehicle propulsion system are very different from a gasoline one. In an EV, electrochemical reactions in the lithium ion cells create electricity. That electricity flows through power electronics that control the voltage and current, then it flows to electromagnets in the motor that create powerful magnetic fields rotating the shaft to turn the wheels. The power required to rotate this shaft has the most correlation to traditional measures of horsepower. However, the chain actually begins in the electrochemical reactions that happen in the battery pack. Depending on the battery's temperature, state of charge and age, the amount of electricity extracted can vary widely."

A Grain of Salt,2016-06-09,"A few things need to be cleared up about the supposed safety of Model S suspensions:



First, there is no safety defect with the suspensions in either the Model S or Model X. Since we own all of our service centers, we are aware of every incident that happens with our customer cars and we are aware of every part that gets replaced. Whenever there is even a potential issue with one of those parts, we investigate fully. This, combined with extensive durability testing, gives us high confidence in our suspensions. With respect to the car that is discussed in the blog post that led to yesterday’s news (more on the blog post below), the suspension ball joint experienced very abnormal rust. We haven’t seen this on any other car, suggesting a very unusual use case. The car had over 70,000 miles on it and its owner lives down such a long dirt road that it required two tow trucks to retrieve the car. (One to get the car to the highway and one to get it from the highway to the service center.) When we got the car, it was caked in dirt."
